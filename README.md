Executive Summary 

1.	Objective:  

The primary objective of the Power BI dashboard is to analyze and visualize customer behavior patterns to support data-driven decisionmaking for business optimization. This includes: 

2.	Steps: 

.1. Converting raw CSV files to XLS format for compatibility. 

.2. Importing the raw XLS data into Power BI. 

.3. Employing Python scripts to clean and preprocess the data without altering the original database. 

.4. Applying filters to omit unnecessary information. 

.5. Creating essential metrics and KPI’s, including qualification-wise totals, yearly and monthly enrolment figures, gender distribution, and state-wise analysis. 

.6. Utilizing Power BI's visual tools to create dashboard’s that make data insights accessible. 

3.	Narratives: 

The "Customer Behavior Insights" dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive view of customer purchasing behavior by integrating multiple data points into a visually interactive format. This dashboard is split into two pages, each targeting specific aspects of customer activity, product performance, and promotional effectiveness. 

4.	Metrics:

Repeat customers (identified through prior purchases) showed higher average transaction values, indicating the importance of retention strategies. 

Introduction: 

In the current competitive market, understanding customer behaviour is crucial for sustainable growth. This project focuses on analysing customer purchase patterns using Power BI dashboards. It highlights how visual analytics can drive data-driven decisions in marketing and sales. 

ProblemStatement: 

Lack of real-time actionable insights from raw customer data leading to suboptimal strategic decisions. 

Scope: 

•	Dashboard-based insights on customer purchase behaviour. 

•	Trends across season, size, payment method, item category, etc. • 	Promotional impact on purchases Innovation-Component: 

Use of Power BI visualizations and interactive dashboards for granular customer segmentation and real-time analysis. Goals: 

•	Visualize Customer Demographics and Behaviour 

To present a clear breakdown of customer data such as gender, size preference, and seasonal trends in a way that is easy to interpret and actionable. 

•	TrackProduct Performance Across Categories 

To analyze which item categories (e.g., pants, shirts, blouses) are most frequently purchased and how they are rated by customers. 

•	Evaluate the Effectiveness of Discounts and Promotions 

To understand how the use of promo codes and applied discounts impact customer purchasing decisions and overall sales. • Understand Preferred Payment and Shipping Methods 

To uncover customer preferences regarding how they pay and how they choose to receive their products, which can help improve checkout and logistics strategies. 

•	Identify Review Patterns for Customer Satisfaction 

To assess customer satisfaction by analyzing review ratings by product and size, offering insights into product quality and fit. • Reveal Seasonal Trends and Buying Cycles 

To examine customer behavior across different seasons, supporting better planning for marketing campaigns and inventory management. • Support Data-Driven Business Decisions 

To empower stakeholders with actionable insights through visual storytelling, enabling smarter decisions in marketing, sales, and operations. 

Scope: 

•	Customer Behaviour Analysis 

The dashboard provides insights into customer demographics, purchasing habits, seasonal preferences, and product choices. • Sales & Promotion Impact Evaluation 

Enables evaluation of the effectiveness of discounts, promo codes, and seasonal sales in driving revenue and customer retention. 

•	Product Performance Insights 

Helps identify high-performing products based on purchase frequency and customer review ratings. • Operational Insights 

Offers data-driven guidance for improving logistics by analyzing shipping preferences and payment method trends. 

•	Business Decision Support 

Supports marketing, inventory, and product planning teams with visually compelling, real-time insights into customer data. 

s 

•	Static Data Snapshot 

The dashboard is built on a static dataset and does not reflect real-time updates, which limits its usefulness for ongoing operations or live decision-making. 

•	Limited Demographic Details 

Only gender is considered under demographics; age, location, income level, and other important customer attributes are not included. 

•	No Predictive Analytics 

The dashboard focuses on historical data analysis and does not include forecasting or predictive modeling (e.g., predicting future sales trends). 

•	Promo Code Performance Lacks ROI Metrics 

While promo code usage is visualized, there's no direct measurement of return on investment (ROI) from promotions. • Limited Customer Segmentation 

The dashboard segments customers based on a few basic features but does not include advanced clustering or segmentation techniques (e.g., RFM analysis). • Not Mobile-Optimized 

Depending on how it's deployed, the visual layout may not be fully optimized for mobile or tablet views.
